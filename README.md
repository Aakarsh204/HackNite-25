Problem Statement:

Education

Develop a personalized, Al-driven educational platform that dynamically adapts learning pathways and content delivery based on real-time student engagement, emotional state, and cognitive load, captured through multimodal data (e.g., eye-tracking, facial expression analysis, speech patterns, interaction logs). The challenge lies in creating a system that not only optimizes knowledge acquisition but also fosters intrinsic motivation and emotional well-being, while maintaining ethical considerations regarding student privacy and data usage.
